##web-APIs-code-quiz

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers



##Introduction

In this weeks challengeI applied skills ive leanred with APIs and Java script to build a coding quiz. This application allows you to take a timed based data coding quiz. The timer keeps track of of how long it takes you to completet the quiz. While also penalizing to you for answering a question incorrectly by subtracting 10 seconds off your score time. Answer all questions as fast as you can to get the highest score. quiz will end after all questions have been answered of the timer runs out. After completing the quiz add your name to record your highscore. Then check the leader board to see your rankings!
